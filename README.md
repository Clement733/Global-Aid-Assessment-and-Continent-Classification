My project, "Global Aid Assessment and Continent Classification," is a comprehensive data science endeavor that tackles two key aspects of understanding and assisting countries worldwide. In the first branch, I apply advanced clustering techniques to assess which countries might require international aid. Utilizing a diverse dataset covering important socio-economic indicators, including GDPP, health, child mortality, and more, I aim to categorize nations into distinct groups: those in dire need of assistance, those that could benefit from support, and those currently self-sustaining.

In the second branch, I delve into the realm of classification by building predictive models to determine the continent to which a country belongs. Leveraging the same dataset, I explore patterns and relationships among the data to create accurate classifiers. My goal is to demonstrate the power of machine learning in discerning geographical patterns based on socio-economic data.

Overall, "Global Aid Assessment and Continent Classification" is a data-driven project aimed at shedding light on the diverse challenges and opportunities faced by countries across the world. It combines clustering and classification techniques to provide a holistic view of our global community, contributing to my understanding of where international aid efforts may be most impactful and enhancing my knowledge of the factors that define continents.
